Scanning Bluetooth devices

Milestones covered:

10/31/2013: <br/>
  a. Till now once an app is launched. it straight asks user to start BlueTooth. <br/>
  b. App is able to sense and list out nearby BlueTooth devices. <br/>
     (Done: added logic where scanned device is added only once into the Arraylist, need to test this case) <br/>
  
Next Milestone: (May be by 1/10/2013)<br/>
  a. [Done] Rather than asking user to scan devices, app should automatically start searching once the bluetooth is on.<br/>
  b. [In progress] How to do pairing and createbond with other BlueTooth Device.
